## ✅ Conclusion

This project successfully combines data science techniques with cricket domain knowledge to derive actionable insights from IPL auction data. Through SQL-driven analysis, Python-based visualizations, and structured modeling via ER and UML diagrams, we uncover how teams allocate budgets, which player types are most valued, and what patterns dominate the bidding process. These insights can be valuable to analysts, fans, and strategists aiming to understand the financial and performance aspects of professional T20 cricket.
